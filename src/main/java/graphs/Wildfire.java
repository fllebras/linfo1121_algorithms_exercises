/**
 * Let's consider a forest represented as a 2D grid.
 * Each cell of the grid can be in one of three states:
 *
 * 0 representing an empty spot.
 * 1 representing a tree.
 * 2 representing a burning tree (indicating a wildfire).
 *
 * The fire spreads from a burning tree to its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) if there's a tree there.
 * Each minute, the trees in the neighboring cells of burning tree catch on fire.
 *
 * Your task is to calculate how many minutes it would take for the fire to spread throughout the forest i.e. to burn all the trees.
 *
 * If there are trees that cannot be reached by the fire (for example, isolated trees with no adjacent burning trees),
 * we consider that the fire will never reach them and -1 is returned.
 *
 * The time-complexity of your algorithm must be O(n) with n the number of cells in the forest.
