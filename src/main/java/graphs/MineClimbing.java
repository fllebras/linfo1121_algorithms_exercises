/**
 * You just bought yourself the latest game from the Majong™
 * studio (recently acquired by Macrosoft™): MineClimb™.
 * In this 3D game, the map is made up of size 1
 * dimensional cube blocks, aligned on a grid,
 * forming vertical columns of cubes.
 * There are no holes in the columns, so the state
 * of the map can be represented as a matrix M of size n⋅m
 * where the entry M_{i,j} is the height of
 * the cube column located at i,j (0 ≤ i < n, 0 ≤ j < m).
 * You can't delete or add cubes, but you do have
 * climbing gear that allows you to move from one column to another
 * (in the usual four directions (north, south, east, west),
 * but not diagonally). The world of MineClimb™ is round:
 * the position north of (0,j) is (n-1,j), the position
 * west of (i,0) is (i,m-1) , and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * The time taken to climb up or down a column depends on
 * the difference in height between the current column and the next one.
 * Precisely, the time taken to go from column (i,j)
 * to column (k,l) is |M_{i,j}-M_{k,l}|
 * <p>
 * Given the map of the mine, an initial position
 * and an end position, what is the minimum time needed
 * to reach the end position from the initial position?
